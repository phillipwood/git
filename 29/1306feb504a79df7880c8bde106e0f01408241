NB the test for 'rebase -i' breaks when git is compiled with
GETTEXT_POISON=1. I've bisected it to 18633e1a22 ("rebase -i: use the
rebase--helper builtin", 2017-2-9) which is neither a huge surprise as
the shell version does not suffer from this or very helpful as it
doesn't pinpont where the problem is (presumably something in
sequencer.c) I've not had time to look into this yet.
