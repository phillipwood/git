I'm not sure what to do with action_names, I moved it to keep it near
the definition of the enum. The extra commands in the enum are not
traced so they don't need to be in action_names but it looks odd to
leave them out. Also I don't understand why action_names in NULL
terminated or the names are marked for translation as it is used in
	trace2_cmd_mode(action_names[action]);
so we don't use the NULL termination or translate the names (I'd be
surprised if we did for tracing)
