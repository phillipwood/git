This has semantic conflicts with ra/rebase-i-more-options as it does not
respect the options passed to rebase when the user commits

I haven't checked how this affects the shell prompt in contrib yet, I
suspect it may need changing to cope the presence of CHERRY_PICK_HEAD
during a rebase.

I'd like to change the existing authorship tests to rely on the "Original
Author" changes here, but they are a web of hidden interdependencies which is
hard to untangle.
